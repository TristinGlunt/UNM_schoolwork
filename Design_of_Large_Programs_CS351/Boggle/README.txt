=========================HOW TO PLAY============================
1. At launch, select rules to learn how Boggle is played
2. Select whether you want to play on a 4x4 or 5x5 board
3. You have 3 minutes (timer in red on left)
4. Select board pieces with mouse to spell out word
5. When piece is selected, possible moves is highlighted in light blue
6. When you have spelled out your word, press ENTER on your keyboard to enter
currently spelt word.
7. Guessed words that were in our dictionary are put under the word list under 
green color, and words that are not in our dictionary are red.
NOTE: Words must be greater than 3 characters, and capital or foreign words are not allowed.
Refer to rules for more about accepted spellings of words.
8. While playing, you can rotate the board either to right or left for a new view point
using the rotate left and rotate right buttons below the board.
9. Once the timer ends, you are shown your total score. You are also shown all of the
possible words you could have guessed. I LOVE this. It's always shown me the correct words,
it's sometimes taken me 10m+ to verify it because how crazy it is, but it's always been there!
So, if you're checking, please take your time because it's still hard to verify the word from 
my experience!
10. Finally, you can decide to play again by clicking the play again button and start back at step 1.

---- Current bugs -----
1. To launch the game properly with the correct resources (pictures, dictionary, etc.) you must download the entire
project and run the jar. You can not run the jar without the other files, even though the files are
included in the jar per "How to turn in a project" instructions.


Main entry point of program is Main.
